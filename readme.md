# React-Family-Tree-King-Shan
## Tree traversal in React Js to work on family tree of King Shan

Please note that this task is solved online on github in c++ and java language -- https://github.com/bhupankarg/KingShanFamilyTree/blob/master/Geektrust-Problems1.pdf  and   https://github.com/deeksharastogi/geektrust  

I have solved the task in ReactJs, which uses completely original code and logic. I have intentionally used only one html file which has all the js code, for the sake of simplicity. I could have taken out the family tree json data in a separate file and also could have taken "findXYZ"(e.g. findFather) functions in a separate file. 

On a production level, I would have used Next.js with json file as actual live database, or for a front end app create react app. Those apprpoaches would need the examiner to install node and npm etc. With single html file using react cdns, I have made it easier for non technical guys to run and test the code.
