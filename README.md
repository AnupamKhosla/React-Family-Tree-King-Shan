Tree traversal in React Js to work on family tree of King Shan
Please note that this task is solved online on github in c++ and java language:

Another solution based on javascript Node Js with better testing and structure:

I have solved the task in ReactJs, which uses completely original code and logic. I have intentionally used only one html file which has all the js code, for the sake of simplicity. I could have taken out the family tree json data in a separate file and also could have taken "findXYZ"(e.g. findFather) functions in a separate file.

On a production level, I would have used Next.js with json file as actual live database, or for a front end app create react app. Those apprpoaches would need the examiner to install node and npm etc. With single html file using react cdns, I have made it easier for non technical guys to run and test the code.
